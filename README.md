# Data Mining Design Using CRISP-DM

## Overview
This project uses the CRISP-DM methodology to explore the relationship between midterm and final exam grades through a predictive linear regression model. The goal is to predict final exam grades based on midterm performance, offering educators actionable insights for improving student outcomes.

## Features
- **CRISP-DM Phases**: The project follows all six phases of CRISP-DM: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment.
- **Linear Regression Modeling**: The model predicts final grades from midterm scores, quantifying their relationship with key metrics like R-squared and p-values.
- **Data Visualization**: Scatterplots and regression lines visualize grade relationships, aiding in understanding trends and predictions.

   The full project report, detailing the CRISP-DM phases, analysis, and results.
2. **Jupyter Notebook**  
   Code implementing linear regression, generating visualizations, and calculating key metrics.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python libraries:
  - `matplotlib`
  - `numpy`
  - `statsmodels`
  - `scipy`

Install the dependencies using:
pip install matplotlib numpy statsmodels scipy

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/jovanthompsonmds/Data-Mining-Design-Using-CRISP-DM.git

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the code to:
- Load the data
- Perform linear regression
- Visualize the results
- Analyze the relationship between midterm and final exam grades

## Insights
The analysis shows a moderately strong positive linear relationship between midterm and final grades, with an R-squared value of 0.613. The predictive model can help educators identify students who may need extra support and provide data-driven insights for improving academic strategies.
